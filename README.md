# SF_Project_Final

- Final Project for bootcamp
- Data analysis and visualization on benefits across different careers throughout the city of San Francisco

## Visualizations

- Initially, visualizations of the job and benefits market in San Francisco were made using Plotly and D3js libraries. A pie chart per employee was made to depict their benefits and job status, and a bar chart was made based on job title and year

- An interactive D3 visualization was made to switch between axes and depict different parameters such as year, benefits and total pay. This was depicted as a scatter plot, with each plot depicting a different employee

- Due to the arrangement of the scatter plots, it was decided to try and change the scatter plot into a line graph, but given the problems encountered with the slowness of loading the visualizations on D3, we switched to multiple Tableau visualizations, where we were able to make not only line graphs but also bubble plots and bar charts

- A machine learning visualization was also created

## Inferences

- There was a drastic increase in the benefits market in San Francisco from 2011-2012, but there was a rapid decrease from 2012-2013 with a small increase from 2013-2014. Overall, the benefits market has improved since 2011

- Males earn more than females and null gendered individuals

- Females earn more overall than null-gendered people but the latter earned more overtime and beenfits pay than females in 2013 and 2o14, despite females having more benefits in 2012

- Full time workers have more benefits

- Transit workers in San Francisco have the most employees

- There are more males in professions like firefighters and transit workers, but more females in nursing
